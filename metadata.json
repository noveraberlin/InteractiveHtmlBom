    "description_full": "This plugin generates a convenient Bill of Materials (BOM) listing with the ability to visually correlate and easily search for components and their placements on the PCB. It is particularly useful when hand-soldering a prototype, as it allows users to quickly find locations of components groups on the board. It is also possible to reverse lookup the component group by clicking on a footprint on the board drawing.\nThe plugin utilizes Pcbnew python API to read PCB data and render silkscreen, fab layer, footprint pads, text, and drawings. BOM table fields and grouping is fully configurable, additional columns, such as a manufacturer ID, can be added in Schematic editor and imported either through the netlist file, XML file generated by Eeschema's internal BOM tool, or from board file itself.\nThere is an option to include tracks/zones data as well as netlist information allowing dynamic highlight of nets on the board.This plugin generates a convenient Bill of Materials (BOM) listing with the ability to visually correlate and easily search for components and their placements on the PCB.
